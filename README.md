# hermit-no-std

`hermit-no-std` is a demo to boot a Hermit application without the _Rust Standard Library_.
The interface to the kernel is not (yet) stable and can change between kernel versions.

Instead of using the crate [hermit-kernel](https://crates.io/crates/hermit-kernel), it is also possible to integrate the kernel as git submodule.
The branch `dev` is an example for this use case.

## Requirements

* [`rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Building the no-std application

```sh
cargo build
```

## Booting the no-std application

Download the loader binary from its [releases page](https://github.com/hermit-os/loader/releases).
Afterwards, boot the no-std application with `cargo run` or use following command

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -display none -serial stdio -kernel hermit-loader-x86_64 -cpu Skylake-Client -device isa-debug-exit,iobase=0xf4,iosize=0x04 -smp 1 -m 512M -netdev user,id=u1,hostfwd=tcp::9975-:9975,hostfwd=udp::9975-:9975,net=192.168.76.0/24,dhcpstart=192.168.76.9 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=u1,disable-legacy=on -initrd target/x86_64-unknown-none/debug/hermit-no-std
```
